// Package gate is the startup-notice seam between the open-source core and an
// external build that layers on a subscription. At startup a front-end asks the
// registered Provider for a Status and renders it: a Nag posture draws a banner
// line and the app runs normally; a Blocking posture holds the user on a start
// screen that either clears after a wait (full read/write) or is dismissed into
// read-only. The open-source build registers no provider, so Evaluate always
// returns Full and every front-end runs unimpeded - the core carries no notion
// of what any posture means, only how to draw the three of them.
//
// The seam is deliberately narrow and primitive-typed (ints and strings, no core
// types): the posture is computed entirely in the external build, behind this
// interface, so the open-source binary contains none of that logic. All this
// package knows is a posture number, a message, and a wait.
