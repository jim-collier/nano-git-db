#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		Build a populated copy of the issue-tracker demo in a scratch dir, so a
##		live demo (especially the web UI) starts with data already in it. The
##		walkthrough itself creates this same data by hand; this is the shortcut
##		when you'd rather skip straight to showing it off. The database is
##		registered as "issues" in a registry kept inside the scratch dir (so it
##		never touches your real one), and every command just names it.
##	Syntax:
##		seed.bash [workdir]     ## default workdir: /tmp/ngdb-issues-demo
##	Notes:
##		Content is fake (demo user, /tmp paths). Prints the exact serve + CLI
##		commands to use against the seeded db when it finishes.
