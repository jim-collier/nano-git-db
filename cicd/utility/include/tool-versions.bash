# Pinned versions of the linters/scanners the pipeline runs via `go run`. One
# place so results don't drift across machines or over time. These stay out of
# go.mod on purpose (no vendored tool dep); dependabot bumps go.mod deps and the
# toolchain, these pins are bumped by hand when a scan wants a newer tool.
