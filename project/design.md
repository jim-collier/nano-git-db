## Goal

A super-robust database creation tool with many bells and whistles inherited by default without having to specify anything, and powerful additional "add-ons" that table definitions can opt-in to. The UI and data model are tightly correlated, in terms of definition.

The schema can be changed via DDL mid-project, without affecting existing data, no other users who haven't synced with the latest DDL yet.

In spite of being a SQL backend, data is saved one-field at a time - as long as the minimum required fields are met.

## CI/CD pipeline

Manually kicked off via `cicd/cicd.bash`. Stages, in order (each fails early and hard on a real problem, exit >0):

- **Build** native size-optimized, then cross-compile (windows-amd64, linux-arm64, windows-arm64; pure Go, no extra toolchains), zip windows into `dist/`.
- **Lint + format**: `gofmt -w` rewrites Go in place (never Bash), then `staticcheck` gates. `go vet` runs in test.bash.
- **Tests**: full regression suite (`go test`), which also runs every fuzz target's seed corpus.
- **Fuzz**: `cicd/utility/fuzz.bash` auto-discovers each `FuzzXxx` and runs it a short budget; a crash fails the run.
- **Security + supply-chain**: `go mod verify`, `govulncheck`, and `gosec` (with a documented exclude list justified for a local-first single-user git-synced tool).
- **Profiler** (non-gating artifact): samples the CPU-hot tx-log replay path, renders an inferno flamegraph into `cicd/artifacts/profiling/` (GFS-rotated), and prints a hotspot summary (`flame-report.py`). Tooling misses warn and skip.
- **Dogfood**: copy the native release to the local run path.
- **Screenshots**: regenerate the README thumbnails.
- **Publish**: `n8git_backup-and-publish`.

The whole run is tee'd to a rotated `cicd/artifacts/lint/run_<ts>.log` so warnings from any stage can be reviewed after the fact (`lint-report.bash`). `--quick` skips the slow stages (cross-builds, fuzz, profiler, screenshots, govulncheck, gosec); lint + tests still run. Every step is capped to at most half the cores (`cpu-limit.bash`: `GOMAXPROCS` + `-p`). `cicd/artifacts/` is gitignored.

## Language and stack

Go. Picked for trivial static cross-compilation (`GOOS`/`GOARCH`, `CGO_ENABLED=0`) to every target with no C toolchains. Hard rule: **stay pure-Go (no cgo)** - the moment a dependency needs cgo, per-target C cross-toolchains come back and the whole reason for choosing Go is gone.

Binary size is a real goal (though not the absolute top priority it would be for a Rust build): build with `-ldflags="-s -w"`, prefer lean deps, consider `upx`. Realistic floor is ~8-15 MB (GC runtime + pure-Go SQLite), vs the ~2-5 MB a Rust build would hit - the accepted cost of Go's cross-compile simplicity.

| Concern    | Choice                   | Why
| :--        | :--                      | :--
| SQLite     | `modernc.org/sqlite`     | Pure-Go (C transpiled to Go), no cgo. Larger/slower than `mattn/go-sqlite3` but cross-compiles clean.
| Git sync   | shell out to `git`       | Design only needs pull/merge/commit/push on the log dir. Avoids libgit2 bulk. Revisit only if conflict handling outgrows the CLI.
| Tx log CSV | stdlib `encoding/csv`    | Canonical, zero dep.
| Scripting  | `gopher-lua`             | Pure-Go Lua 5.1. Well-known embedded language, easy syntax, easy to sandbox and expose the CRUD API into. External `python3` via exec stays available as the worst-case fallback.
| IDs (GUID) | `google/uuid`            | v4/v7, stored as 16-byte blob, hex/base64 at the boundaries.
| CLI        | TBD (lean stdlib `flag`) | Large flag surface; stdlib `flag` favours size, move to `cobra` only if subcommand ergonomics demand.
| Formatting | `gofmt`                  | Tabs-native, matches house style for free.

One binary, four front-ends (see Architecture). UI is two pure-Go tiers: a **TUI** (`tview`/`tcell`) and a **local web UI**. The web tier is deliberately stdlib-only - `net/http` (Go 1.22+ `ServeMux` does method + path routing, so no `chi`/`gorilla`), `html/template` (auto context-aware escaping), and `embed` to bake assets into the binary. Client-side interactivity is **htmx**: a single ~15 KB JS file, vendored and pinned by SRI hash - no npm, no build chain, no transitive deps. Net web-tier third-party Go deps: **zero**. A native GUI (Fyne/Wails) stays rejected - both need cgo/webview and would break the pure-Go cross-compile.

## Architecture

One static binary, a shared core with four thin front-end adapters over it. Build the engine once; each interface is a mode selected at startup.

~~~text
                 ------------ core engine (internal API) -------------
                 |  DDL parse . SQLite view . git tx-log . CRUD      |
                 -----------------------------------------------------
                    |          |           |              |
main dispatch:     CLI      Lua host      TUI         Web server
~~~

- **CLI arg API** - stdlib `flag`, calls core directly.
- **Lua native API** - `gopher-lua` registers Go funcs so scripts call the *same* core CRUD API (not a second code path).
- **TUI** - `tview`/`tcell`.
- **Web UI** - stdlib `net/http` + `html/template` + `embed`, htmx for dynamic grid/form swaps.

The four are different run modes, not concurrent contenders (`<verb>` = CLI, `--tui`, `--serve`); the web server is just goroutines. Lua is callable from any mode. Every front-end is a thin adapter - all real logic lives in the core, so behaviour can't drift between interfaces.

Supply-chain hardening (from day one): vendor everything (`go mod vendor`, commit `vendor/`) so builds never hit the network and every dep is diffable in PRs; `go mod verify` + hash-pinned `go.sum`; build `-mod=vendor`/`-mod=readonly`; `govulncheck` in the manual CI pipeline; minimal-dep policy (prefer stdlib, each module a deliberate call); vendored `htmx.min.js` pinned by SRI hash.

## Logical code organization

Standard Go layout, with the **module root under `source/`** so all source - including vendored deps - lives there. Core is a library; `main` is a thin dispatcher. Import paths are `github.com/jim-collier/nano-git-db/internal/...` (no `source` segment); run `go` from `source/`.

~~~text
source/go.mod, go.sum         - module root (module github.com/jim-collier/nano-git-db)
source/vendor/                - committed third-party deps; build uses -mod=vendor
source/cmd/ngdb/main.go  - arg dispatch -> one of the four modes
source/internal/core/         - engine: the single source of truth for all logic
	ddl/                      - DDL parser + schema model
	store/                    - SQLite view (modernc.org/sqlite), migrations
	txlog/                    - git-backed CSV transaction log, sync, GC
	crud/                     - CRUD API the front-ends + Lua all call
source/internal/cli/          - stdlib flag front-end
source/internal/lua/          - gopher-lua host, Go<->Lua CRUD bindings
source/internal/tui/          - tview/tcell front-end
source/internal/web/          - net/http handlers, html/template, embedded assets
	assets/                   - html/css + vendored, SRI-pinned htmx.min.js (go:embed)
~~~

`internal/` keeps the core unimportable by outside modules (no accidental public API surface). Front-ends depend on `core`, never on each other.

## Initial high-level features

### User-definable DDL

`example.ddl` contains an example schema DDL. It's vaguely YAML-like, but looser and domain-specific.

It can define tables, fields, relationships, indexes, unique constraints, validation, code execution (e.g. triggers, events), UI views, inherit prepackaged features,

Also:

- Spaces OR tabs are OK, as long as its consistent.

- The hierarchy does not have to be unique: restating a section (`database:`, `tables:`, even nested ones) merges its children into the first occurrence in document order, so long files can re-open a section instead of scrolling back to the right indent. Entities (`table:`, `field:`, `relationship:`, `view:`, `block:`) always stay separate. A scalar key redefined to a *different* value keeps the first value and warns.

- Hierarchies can be short-handed with '/': `database/tables/table: "t1"` is the same as the nested form. ('/' over '.' or '|' because the example DDL uses it, '.' already appears in numeric values and reads as TOML dotted keys, and '|' reads as alternation in this file's own comments.)

- Wrapper levels `database:` (over `tables:`/`relationships:`) and `ui:` (over `views:`, plus `default_view`) are transparent; older flat DDLs without them still parse. Same for `methods:`, renamed to `code:` - both keys are read.

- Numeric values in this DDL can have a bare leading or trailing '.'.

- If the DDL file is updated while an existing DB has data, the local `.sqlite` is either updated on-the-fly, or rebuilt.

- The fields referenced in the transaction log are never deleted or changed. References to past and future nonexistent fields in the DDL are ignored.

- Functions are written in external python3, or better yet some non-SQL programming-like scripting language the main program can host internally. At worst, the functions would only have access to the executable CLI args interface. At best, an internal CRUD API.

- Warn if it looks like user created a primary key field, which already exists.

- Load-time validation fixes what it safely can with a warning - nameless or redefined tables/fields are dropped (first definition wins), a field colliding with an auto-added system column is dropped, an unknown field type stores as text - and hard-errors only on genuine ambiguity (mixed tab/space indentation). Same philosophy on the tx-log: torn or unreadable lines skip with a warning naming the file and line, repeated header rows (union-merge leftovers) skip silently, and replay skips-and-warns entry-local data errors (mangled row id, an operation this build does not know - possibly a newer client's) exactly like schema drift.

- Most DDL fields are optional, with sane defaults.

- Special values (without quotes):

	- **Null value**: NULL
	- **Function**: some_function_name()
	- **SQL**: \`SELECT * FROM ...\`
	- **String**: "A string with o'l spaces" or 'A string with "literal" quotes' or AstringWithNoSpaces.
	- **Boolean**: true|false|1|0|T|f|yes|no|enable[d]|disable[d]|y|n
	- **Number**; `10`, `1,000`, `.1`, `1.`, `0.1`, `1.0`.
	- **Date/time**: Anything internal parser or `printf` can interpret. String, linux/unix epoch float, Excel-style float on Windows, etc.

### Transaction log

The transaction log is the backbone of the database. The actual SQL database is just the local view into it, and not the single-source of truth.

After the program loads with a local view of the SQLite database, it begins in the background:

- Syncs the transaction log via git, with remote repo. (If log is in a git repo.)

- Auto-resolves conflicts. Mechanism: the log file is set to `merge=union` in `.gitattributes`, so two clients' concurrent appends combine instead of conflicting. Ordering is not left to the merge - replay sorts entries by `(date, tx_id)`, a deterministic total order, so every client's view converges to the same state regardless of how git interleaved the lines. (Shells out to `git`; a non-git log dir just skips sync.)

- Syncs the local SQLite database with the transaction log, handling conflicts.

- If the current record being shown by the app got deleted during that process, warn the user and allow them to recreate it if necessary, or else change to the next real record.

- CSV format

Fields:

- tx_id (hex or base64 GUID)
- date (GMT)
- table_name
- row_id  ## hex GUID of the affected row. Added during implementation - field-level ops can't be applied without a row identifier.
- field_name  ## Can be blank if record-level only
- operation (create, update, mark_delete, delete)
- new_value
- user_id
- ok_to_garbage_collect
- host_name  ## Machine that wrote the entry. One user can write from several hosts.

Reads map columns by the header row's names, not by position, so field order does not affect compatibility. A column can be reordered, added, or dropped and older and newer clients still read each other's logs: an unknown extra column is ignored, and a column a record lacks (e.g. a pre-host_name row, or a narrower legacy header) defaults to empty. A record only needs enough fields to carry the required columns (through `user_id`); anything shorter is treated as torn. Header rows are recognized by carrying the reserved column names rather than by their first cell, so even the header can be reordered. tx_id remains the conventional first column.

`ok_to_garbage_collect` is populated automatically, when the original record (or table) referred to no longer exists. Only log records N-days old are garbage collected (by any client). Default is 90 days.

`host_name` is stamped automatically from the OS hostname (override with `NANOGITDB_HOST`), the machine analogue of `user_id`'s `NANOGITDB_USER`. It is txlog metadata only - replay does not apply it to the view.

On-disk encoding: every entry is exactly one physical line. Characters that would force CSV quoting or break line-based union merging (newline, return, comma, quotes, backtick, slashes) are stored as named markers - 🗦NEWLINE🗧, 🗦COMMA🗧, etc. - and a `new_value` of exactly 🗦NULL🗧 means SQL NULL (distinct from empty string). Literal 🗦/🗧 in content encode as 🗦LDELIM🗧/🗦RDELIM🗧, so user text can never spoof a marker. Other control characters are scrubbed. Decoding happens on read; the SQLite view always holds the real characters.

GC must preserve the append-only property the union merge depends on: collecting by rewriting lines in-place would make two clients' concurrent GC (or GC racing an append) a real merge conflict. So GC is segment rotation: a client that collects writes the surviving entries to a new log segment and retires the old one whole, rather than editing it. Replay also guarantees a hard-deleted row stays deleted even if its delete entry outlives the row's other entries: update entries sorted after a delete are skipped, only a later create revives the row id.

v1 GC (the `gc <ddl> <logdir>` verb): collectible = every entry of a row whose final state is hard-deleted and whose newest entry is older than `gc_age_days` (default 90); live, revived, and recently-deleted rows keep their history whole. Survivors land in a write-once `txlog-<stamp>-<rand>.csv` segment, the replaced files are removed, and new writes recreate `txlog.csv`; reads walk segments then the live file. Sync stages the whole log dir (so rotations - and the attachments folder - replicate), and `txlog-*.csv` carries the union merge attribute. Two clients collecting concurrently just duplicate survivors across two segments; replay is idempotent, so views converge and the next pass collapses them. Eligibility is computed at collect time; the `ok_to_garbage_collect` column stays in the format as a future cross-client signal.

### Scripting triggers

Scripting is an enterprise-edition feature. The core exposes a script seam (the same open-core shape as encryption); the enterprise build registers the Lua host, and the open-source build has none, so it ignores `code:` hooks and rejects `--script`.

The DDL's `code:` keys name Lua functions defined in a `.lua` sidecar next to the DDL (same base name, like `.queries`); no sidecar means no triggers. The core wires the write-path hooks through the seam, so every front-end fires them identically:

- Field `before_update(table, field, value)` -> `pass [, new_value]`: an explicit `false` cancels the write; a second return replaces the value. Runs before the table-level hook, per the design's ordering note.
- Table `before_update(table, fields)` -> `pass`: sees the field hooks' output; explicit `false` vetoes the whole write.
- Field `after_update(table, row_id, field, value)` and table `after_update(table, row_id)`: fire after the commit lands; failures warn but cannot undo.
- App `before_open(name, logdir)` -> `pass`: `false` vetoes the open; `after_open` fires once triggers are live.
- Trigger code gets the same sandboxed `db.*` API as `--script`. Writes made while a trigger executes do not re-fire triggers (no reentrancy), so a hook updating another row cannot recurse.
- A `code:` key naming a function the sidecar does not define warns at open and never blocks writes. Replay never fires triggers - they ran on the originating client.
- Deferred: `before_sync`/`after_sync` (sync loop), `before_viewchange`/`after_viewchange`/`before_close`/`after_close` (UI lifecycle), and `validation:`'s `method:` key.

### Schema renames

`--rename-table` / `--rename-field` rewrite the DDL file in place (line-based, so comments and formatting survive; the old name is recorded on an `aliases:` line) and ALTER the SQLite view. The append-only tx-log is never rewritten: replay translates aliased table/field names to their current names, so history recorded under the old name keeps applying after any number of renames. First definition wins on conflicting aliases, like every other schema merge.

### Tunable options

- git_sync_frequency = 60  ## seconds between syncing the transaction log.
- gc_age_days = 90  ## only log records older than this are garbage collected.

v1 notes: tunables live in a `tunables:` DDL section; both `key: value` and the `key = value` form above parse. Unknown keys warn but still store (a newer client's tunable survives). `git_sync_frequency` paces the background sync loop the TUI and web UIs start when the log dir is a git work tree - each pull that brings new entries full-replays into the view (the safe apply until incremental apply lands); 0 disables the loop. `gc_age_days` is consumed by tx-log GC when that lands.

### Startup discovery and database registry

How a run finds a database when it was not handed the explicit `<ddl> <sqlite> <logdir>` triple:

- A lone `*.ddl` in the current directory is used directly (the sqlite view defaults beside it, the tx-log dir is that directory). Zero or several `.ddl` files are ambiguous, so discovery falls through.
- Otherwise the interactive front-end (bare `ngdb` or `--tui`) shows a registry picker; the non-interactive ones (`--serve`, CLI verbs) require the explicit paths and error otherwise (no picker).

The registry is per-database TOML records under a config base: `<os-user-config>/ngdb/<name>/config.toml`, where the base is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (else `~/.config`) on Linux, `%AppData%` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS - whatever `os.UserConfigDir` returns. Read-only system bases (`$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`, default `/etc/xdg`; `%ProgramData%` on Windows) are also searched, after the user base. A record holds: `name`, `ddl_path`, `log_dir` (the git-synced artifacts), `sqlite_path`, `key_file` (local, unsynced; both default beside the record and are rebuildable / re-fetchable), `encryption` and `last_opened`. `key_file`/`encryption` are stored for a stable format ahead of the encryption feature.

Discovery lists every record across the bases, name-sorted, and lightly validates each: its DDL must exist and parse. A record that fails still appears in the picker, flagged `[!] <name>` with the reason (missing/corrupt DDL), so a broken database is visible rather than silently dropped. A missing sqlite view is never an error - it rebuilds from the log on open. The picker always offers "Create new database" (register a new record pointing at a DDL + tx-log, then open) and "Open existing ..." (open a DDL + tx-log ad-hoc, without registering). Opening a registered database stamps its `last_opened`.

The `--init`, `--config`, and `--encrypt` CLI flags drive the same registry from the command line (see the CLI/encryption sections). DDL-authoring for a truly-new database remains a separate, later item.

### UI

- When a view specifies `startup_named_query`, that named query's dataset loads as soon as the view opens. Only when it is empty or unspecified does the view open with no records shown - then you have to query, e.g. via "All" button, or via predefined query dropdown.
- The default view (`ui:` -> `default_view`, else the first view defined) opens on startup in both UIs. Its blocks still load empty per the no-records-until-asked rule; a `default_view` naming an unusable view warns and falls back to the first one.
- View rendering (v1): the DDL's layout blocks render as nested splits in both UIs (TUI flexes, web flexbox). A location hint's direction and percent set each split's axis and share; the relative-to element is ignored for now (blocks place in DDL order). Leaf blocks are `grid`, `tree_grid` (rows ordered depth-first along `parent_field`, indented by depth; orphaned or cyclic parents degrade to extra roots rather than hiding rows), or `form` (single-record panel; shows the first record until block linking exists). Blocks over unknown tables are dropped with a warning, a bad `tree_grid` degrades to a plain grid, and `readonly` (view-level, overridable per block) removes the edit affordances. Editing from a web view block currently jumps to the table's form; returning into the view is future polish.

### Predefined queries

Plain text file, similar structure to DDL, e.g.:

~~~text
query_name: "Some name"
	view:		"name of view"
	sort:       5.5
	active:     yes
	SQL:        `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE field1 = 'Joe;'`
~~~

v1 notes: the file is a sidecar to the DDL - same base name, `.queries` extension (`example.ddl` -> `example.queries`); missing file just means no queries. Grammar and load validation match the DDL (nameless/duplicate/no-SQL entries drop with a warning). `view:` scopes a query to one view's dropdown; omitting it offers the query on every view; `active: no` hides it everywhere; dropdown order is by `sort`, file order within ties. Both UIs run a picked query into the view's first block (TUI: 'p' picks, and the dataset renders with the query's own columns; web: dropdown + Run above the blocks). A view's `startup_named_query` that resolves to an active query loads on open per the UI section; an unresolvable name degrades to the normal empty open (with a status note in the TUI when a queries file exists).

### Optional granular access model

Hierarchical access: View -> View's main table -> table -> { field | record }

v1 semantics (everything is open until a DDL populates a list):

- Identity: the write-stamp user (NANOGITDB_USER / OS username) resolved to a live users row by screen_name or github_name; group membership comes from the users<->groups m:m. No user row = no memberships, which with empty lists keeps a userless setup fully working.
- Rule evaluation: blacklist wins over whitelist; an empty whitelist means everyone. Built-in overrides per the DDL comments: owners always pass, admins pass read/write (delete still needs the rule). `mark_delete` and `delete` use the delete rule; create/update use write.
- Write enforcement is in the core CRUD API (all front-ends inherit it): table write/delete rules, field write rules on the touched fields, and - for row_level_access tables - the row's access_rows grants (a granted row needs a shared group; ungranted rows are open).
- Read enforcement is UI-level, computed at catalog build since a process serves one user: unreadable tables vanish from the UIs (with a warning), unreadable fields drop out of grids and forms silently, a view is hidden when its flat access rule fails or its main (first) table is unreadable, and row-granted rows the user lacks are filtered from grids. Raw `query` (CLI/Lua/SQL) is not row/table-gated - the local file is the trust boundary; the write path is the hard gate.

### Startup notice and read-only mode

Two small, general-purpose pieces the core provides so an edition can surface a notice at startup without the core knowing anything about why:

- A neutral `gate` seam, the same open-core shape as the encryption and scripting seams. It carries only a posture, a message, and an optional wait - Full (run normally), Nag (run, but show the message as a banner), or Blocking (hold on a start screen the user either waits out or dismisses). The core knows how to draw those three; it never learns what drives them.
- A generic read-only session flag in the core write funnel: one guard on the single commit path every write goes through, so setting it makes every front-end (CLI, TUI, web) refuse writes while reads keep working. A dismissed Blocking notice lands here.
- The open-source build registers no provider, so the seam always reports Full and the app runs unimpeded. Among the ways to shape this, it was decided to keep the seam neutral and put only the rendering here: any decision logic an edition adds lives on its side, never in the readable public core.

### Web login

The web tier binds `127.0.0.1` only, so on a single machine the loopback binding is the access control and no login is needed. Putting it behind a reverse proxy changes that, so which shape applies is an explicit setting, never guessed (a proxy also connects from loopback, so the server cannot tell the two apart on its own).

- `web_mode` (user-global setting, default `local`): `local` is the passwordless single-user shape; `proxied` requires a login. Any value but the exact word `proxied` falls back to `local`, so a typo fails toward the guarded-but-passwordless mode rather than a broken login wall.
- Local mode identifies the one user with no password - the git account of the log dir's repo, else the OS user (the same default-user resolution the other front-ends use) - and stamps every request as them. Safety-net: if a request ever carries a reverse-proxy header (`X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-Ip` / `Forwarded`) while in local mode, the server refuses to serve. A box accidentally exposed behind a proxy can never run passwordless; the operator must opt into `proxied` and add a login.
- Proxied mode requires a session for every path but the login endpoints and static assets. A login checks a username and password against a local credentials file, then sets a random session cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure when the request arrived over TLS); the session table is in memory, so a restart just re-prompts. The logged-in user is set as the acting user for that request, so the existing user/group access model applies to the web view exactly as it would elsewhere. Because that acting user is shared state, proxied requests are serialized - this is a local UI lightly extended to multi-user, not a high-throughput service.
- Credentials: a `webusers.toml` of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes (stdlib `crypto/pbkdf2`, so no new dependency; random per-password salt, constant-time compare), kept in the config dir OUTSIDE any git-synced tree - password hashes must never ride along in the shared log repo. The `webuser` CLI verb adds or replaces a login (password from `NGDB_WEB_PASSWORD` or a prompt). Stronger methods - 2FA, passkeys, SSO - are an enterprise concern; this is the open-source baseline that makes the server safe to put behind a proxy at all.

### Donations

`--donate`, the TUI Support entry, and the web Support page show a short appeal and one link - the project's `DONATE.md`, which lists the ways to help (GitHub Sponsors and other platforms, wired through `.github/FUNDING.yml`). The in-app copy is a single small source file the front-ends only display; no addresses are embedded in the binary.

It is an open-source-only feature: `donate` is a top-level seam with an `Enabled` switch, and the enterprise (commercial) build turns it off before dispatch, so the paid product carries no `--donate` flag or Support screen.

Where support goes is decided by four files - `DONATE.md`, `.github/FUNDING.yml`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, and the small `donate` source - and `CODEOWNERS` makes them maintainer-owned, so a pull request cannot quietly redirect donations without the maintainer's review. An earlier scheme instead embedded a crypto-address table and signed it with an out-of-repo key; that is set aside for now in favor of these simpler GitHub-native funding files.

### Encrypted transaction log

Optional at-rest encryption so the git-synced log is unreadable to the hosting provider or anyone who obtains the repo. The local SQLite view always holds cleartext (decrypted at replay), so queries, indexes, and uniques are unaffected.

- What is encrypted, and what leaks: only the field VALUE (`new_value`). Every other column - tx_id, date, table_name, row_id, field_name, operation, user_id, host_name, gc flag - stays cleartext, because git's line-union merge and the deterministic (date, tx_id) replay order must both work without a key. So a repo holder can see the schema shape, row ids, who/when/which-host, and row counts, but not the values. This leakage is inherent to keeping a mergeable text log; obscuring table/field names is a possible future hardening (it needs a synced name<->token map).
- Cipher (crypt package): AES-256-GCM under a per-value subkey derived (HKDF-SHA256) from the entry's unique tx_id (plus table/field for domain separation). Every log entry carries a fresh UUIDv7 tx_id, so each subkey encrypts exactly one value - nonce reuse is impossible regardless of record count, and GCM's random-nonce counting limit never applies. A random 12-byte nonce is stored with the ciphertext; the cleartext context (table/field/row) is bound as AEAD additional data, so editing those columns in the repo makes decryption fail rather than silently mis-attributing a value. Stdlib-only (crypto/aes, crypto/cipher, crypto/hkdf, crypto/rand) - no cgo, no new dependency.
- On-disk form: an encrypted value is stored as the `🗦ENC🗧` marker followed by base64url(nonce || ciphertext || tag), one physical line like everything else. A literal user value equal to the marker is escaped by the symbol encoder, so cleartext can never spoof it (the same collision-safety the NULL sentinel uses). Clear and encrypted values coexist per-field in one log, so encryption can be turned on or off at will without rewriting history.
- Key: one 256-bit random key per database, base64 in a text file (mode 0600) kept OUT of the repo - in the local config dir (`DBConfig.KeyFile`, default beside the record) for a registered database, or beside the DDL for an ad-hoc open. Users exchange it out-of-band. `--init --encrypt=on` mints it; it is never regenerated over an existing key (that would strand old data).
- Policy, two layers. DDL `encryption: always|never|auto` at database/table/field (shared, in git): scanning outermost-first, the first always|never locks - a lower level cannot override it (only a higher one can); all-auto defers. Local `--encrypt=on|off|auto` (per-host, in the unsynced registry record): the persistent per-user preference; auto = encrypt-if-key-present. Resolution per field: a DDL always/never wins; otherwise on -> encrypt (clear if no key), auto -> encrypt only if a key is present, off -> clear.
- Degraded and enforced modes: writing an `always` field with no key is refused (the whole write aborts - nothing half-committed). Reading without the key shows encrypted fields empty (the decrypt pass leaves them Enc-marked and Apply binds NULL - the view never holds ciphertext) and warns. Having the key but `--encrypt=off` warns too, for awareness. GC needs no key: it rotates encrypted entries as opaque lines.
- Wiring: encryption happens on the write path (crud commit seals the log copy while the view gets cleartext) and the decrypt pass runs before replay (schema.OpenClientWith / cli replay). All four front-ends inherit it through the shared bring-up.
- Deferred (documented, not built): encrypting the DDL / `.queries` / `.lua` FILES themselves with decrypt/re-encrypt flags; the `ddl:` / `named_queries:` / `config:` file-level encryption labels; and the futures - multiple keys, public/private keys, passphrase-derived keys, and bulk re-encryption under a new key.

### Tables created automatically at new startup (and verified in the background every startup)

Unless otherwise noted, all tables that are automatically created at startup, inherit "## Fields that all tables get, always and immutably".

Core tables like Users, Groups, etc. also inherit things like audit trail, comments, attachments if appropriate, and necessary m:m relationships. Etc.

These tables, the ones are automatically managed, have `cascade_delete` enabled if appropriate.

These are defined in a single source code file (not end-user editable), with the [same DDL language](example.ddl) that users use.

#### Always created and used

##### Users

Populated automatically. User can edit own, "admins" can edit, "owners" group can delete.

- id
- screen_name  ## Defaults to github name
- github_name
- email
- phone
- avatar [image blob]

Has audit trail, comments, and attachments enabled.

##### Groups

Default records that get populated on db creation:

- "owners"  ## First user in user table is part of.
- "admins"  ## First user in user table is part of.
- "users"  ## Regular users
- "guests"  ## Heavily restricted, mostly read-only.

Has audit trail, comments, and attachments enabled.

DB necessarily has this DDL defined implicitly:

~~~text
relationships:
	relationship:  ## auto-named
		type:  m:m
		parent: users
		child: groups
		cascade_delete: y
		enable_audit_trail: y
~~~

#### Automatic features that any table can opt-in to

v1 behavior notes (all writes ride the normal log-first path, so features replicate like data):

- Audit capture happens in the core CRUD API, so every front-end gets it; the audit entries land in the same commit as the data change. "One record for all updates while active for a user" is implemented as: consecutive updates by the same user merge into that user's newest update record (keeping the oldest old-value per field); any other action or another user's update starts a new record. `values` doubles literal quotes (CSV-style) so old values containing quotes stay unambiguous. A hard delete snapshots the row's remaining values into its audit record.
- Copied attachments land in `<logdir>/attachments/<row id>` so they ride the same git sync as the tx-log. The copy is plain io.Copy, which on Linux already behaves like `cp --reflink=auto` (Go copies via copy_file_range(2), which reflinks where the filesystem can).
- Row-level access grants (access_rows + m:m to groups) are writable data now; ENFORCEMENT is the separate granular-access-model item.
- The Lua sandbox exposes comments/URI attachments but deliberately not file attachments - scripts have no file access, and attach-file would be a read-any-file hole.

##### Many-to-many relationships

Can be "opted-in" via the DDL. All relationships stored in one table, "many2many". Fields.

- id  ## Only useful for things like audit trail.
- table_name_1
- table_name_2
- parent_id_1
- parent_id_2

Unique constraint: table_name_1 + table_name_2 + parent_id_1 + parent_id_2 + is_deleted

##### Comments

Multi-row comments are an automatic feature that can be enabled in the DDL. Stored in a single SQL table. Fields:

- id
- table_name
- parent_id
- comment

##### Audit trail

An automatic feature that can be enabled in the DDL. Stored in a single SQL table. It's similar to the transaction log, but only one record exists for all updates to a record while it is active for a user. Fields:

- id
- table_name
- parent_id  ## Row's value of `id` from `table_name`.
- user_id
- date  ## Stored GMT, displayed local time.
- action  ## create, update, mark_delete, delete
- values  ## field1:"old value" field2:"old value"  ## Only list fields that had old values, that changed or were deleted.

This table is excluded from the "additional fields that get added to every table". These are the only fields.

##### Row-level group access

Main access table access_rows:

- id
- table_name
- parent_id  ## from specified table_name

If table_name has audit-trail enabled, then so are the records here belonging to `table_name`. (This applies universally, not just to this table.)

DB necessarily has this DDL defined implicitly:

~~~text
relationships:
	relationship:  ## auto-named
		type:  m:m
		parent: access_rows
		child: groups
		cascade_delete: y
		enable_audit_trail: y
~~~

##### Attachments

###### URI

URI attachments are an automatic feature that can be enabled in the DDL. They can either be referenced in-place via local path or URL, or copied and stored with the repo. (Two different tables.)

Table attachments_uri:

- id
- uri
- description

With a m:m implied between attachments_uri and whatever table has opted in to the feature.

###### Copies

Copied attachments are an automatic feature that can be enabled in the DDL. The file is copied to the same base path as the transaction log, under a subfolder `attachments`, and given the same name as the row ID (with no extension).

Table attachments_copy:

- id  ## Stored filename gets named this.
- name  ## Doc name, default to original document base name.
- description
- og_name  ## Full original filename
- extension  ## original extension

With a m:m implied between attachments_copy and whatever table has opted in to the feature.

Access model implied. Comments, etc.

When opening, a copy is made to local user tmp directory, and given `name_<copy date YYYYmmDD-HHMMSS user local time>.extension`.

Anytime a file is copied, the program should try the internal version of `cp --reflink=auto` (e.g. by API) if available.

### CLI arg-based API

Full crud CLI UI, plus:

- `--rename-table "old" "new"`  ## Renames in DDL and SQLite, and adds aliases in the DDL
- `--rename-field "old" "new"`

### Internal API

If external scripting files can be hosted in-executable, then it stands to reason an internal API should be exposed.

### Scripting

An external file stores functions for DDL-definable triggers, events, methods, etc.

Decided: **Lua** via pure-Go `gopher-lua`, hosted in-executable. Scripts get a `db` global bound to the core CRUD API - `db.create/get/update/setfield/markdelete/delete/query` - so scripting shares the exact code path as every other front-end. The host is sandboxed: only base/table/string/math/coroutine are opened (no os, io, package, or debug). Reachable now via `ngdb --script <script.lua> <ddl> <sqlite> <logdir>`; DDL-wired triggers/methods build on this later.

Original requirements (all met):

- Well-known

- Easy syntax

- Access to powerful programming paradigms even if not used.

- Ideally able to be hosted by the executable. But worst-case, can be invoked externally, and functions would have to call back into the executable with the CLI arg-based API.
